## Description

My motivation behind this project was to make a simple password generator that was more user friendly. I built this project because there are so many password generators out there that do not ask for the user input of what characters they want in their new password. With this new password generator you are now able to chose if you want a password generated with lower case, upper case, numbers, or special chacters. 

During this project I learned how to input functions and if statements into javascript and with the right format watching the generator come to life. 

## Usage

To use this password generator, simply click the generate password button, follow the promps, and then copy your new password.
